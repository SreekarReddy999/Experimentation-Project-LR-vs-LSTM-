# Experimentation-Project-LR-vs-LSTM-
Hello All, In this experiment I tried to see if Linear Regression (LR) model performs better than an LSTM model for a non-time dependent data.
I took the Glassdoor Data Science Job Posting from Kaggle dataset source. I performed necessary data transformations on the data and developed Linear Regression model and an Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model.
